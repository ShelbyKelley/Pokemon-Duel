# Pokemon-Duel

pokemon.c 
	This program currently gets two random numbers between 1 - 151 and parses through the pokemon.csv to find the two pokemon that correspond to these random numbers. It then prints the information of these two pokemon.

pokemon.csv
	The information per pokemon in this csv is: number, name, hp, attack, defense, and speed.

I will be using the source code given in this youtube video as a reference for networking in C:
